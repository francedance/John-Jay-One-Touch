# John-Jay-One-Touch
My very first Android App made for students at John Jay

This is considered a prototype version of John Jay One Touch 1.1 available in Google Playstore 

I say this is super basic level Android programming which I am simply redirecting a user to different links.

What it does:
   Connect students to their CUNY Blackboard, CUNY First, John Jay email server.
